This is a sample project that combines the following:  PHP, YouTube,
OAuth2, CodeIgniter, the CodeIgniter Youtube API Library, and the Google
APIs Client Library for PHP.

I'm releasing this proof of concept to show that it's possible to integrate
the  CodeIgniter Youtube API Library with the Google APIs Client Library for
PHP. Once version 3 of the YouTube API is ready, the CodeIgniter Youtube API
Library will no longer be necessary. All you'll need is the Google APIs Client
Library for PHP which will be able to handle OAuth2 as well as the YouTube
API.

See application/controllers/example.php for the interesting code.
